# **Eastern quoll behaviour and dispersal**

Here we describe the analyses conducted for the article Gee *et al*. (in prep) *Range expansion in a reintroduced mesopredator: do traits drive who colonises new areas?*

**Summary**

Safe havens (also referred to as sanctuaries) are valuable tools for protecting extant species in decline, and reintroducing species into areas from which they were extirpated (Smith *et al*. 2020). For those with conservation-fencing, designs which prevent entry (by invasive species) but do not prevent exit (of species living inside) can allow reintroduce species to disperse into the surrounding landscape (Wilson *et al*. 2020). But does every individual have an equal opportunity to disperse, or is this process driven by genetic and/or phenotypic traits? 

We studied whether behavioural, morphological, and demographic traits drove dispersal in a reintroduced mesopredator (eastern quoll *Dasyurus viverrinus*, ‘murunguny’ in the Indigenous Ngunnawal language) which was reintroduced to a conservation-fenced haven in the Australian Capital Territory in 2016 (Wilson *et al*. 2020, 2021). The unmanaged dispersal of eastern quolls from the reintroduction site to surrounding areas presented a unique research opportunity to compare the individuals constituting the (1) self-regulating core population (henceforth residents), and the (2) recently founded external population (henceforth dispersers). 

Investigating these trends can build our understanding of dispersal behaviour (and its stages of emigration, inter-patch movement, and immigration), how it responds to density-dependence, and how these processes can be managed for metapopulation health.

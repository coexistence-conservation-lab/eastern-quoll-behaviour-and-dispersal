CANBERRA NATURE PARK-
COMBINATION OF FENCES COLLECTED FOR INDIVIDUAL RESERVES. Combined in Arcview under Xtools avx.
All reserves have most of their fences collected, except Mt Majura north & eastern side, ROB ROY leasee boundary and Goorooyaroo (eastern side). 
Fences collected during 2005 were: Nov  the urban edge western sides of Mt Ainslie & Mt Majura, Sept- Urambi Hills interanal, Dec - Stranger Hill,  Nov Callum Brae & Jerra Grasslands


Method   Part of the aim of the project is to provide assetdata to CALM/Rod Florence.  GPS "Garmin GPS II Plus" used to collect points along fence, mainly strainers and gates. Downloaded in PCX5 and converted to Arcview with GarmapXL.  points made into lines by heads up digitising on the screen at about 1 to 4,000 metre scale. Attributes added in Arcview and Excel.
Note ? means no data available.
'Id'- is a unique identification number starting at 1-
'Id_no' - is an 8 digit unique id number.  Note no number is used where data was captured with the GPS.  A number was essential when digitising the Namadgi fences from the 1:10,000 maps  
'Length' - in metres,  as calculated by arcview
'Purpose'- internal = internal stock fence within the reserve. Some are old stock fences that were there before CNP came into existance. Others have been built to assist with horse management, others for park/people management.

'End assm'= strainer assemblies  H/W= hardwood, S=steel, con=concrete, TP=treated pine.
'Inclusions'-  G=gates, FG=flood gates, BG=boom gates.
'Condition'- condition of fence Good=stockproof, Fair=could be made stockproof, Poor= 
expensive to repair, Decrepit= lying on the ground.
'Tenure'-who owns or the status of the land on either side of the fence. In a nn/mm format.
 NatP= national park, Lease=Rural or community or 
business lease, Agist= agistment,ACTF=ACT Forests, NatR=nature reserve, Spec=Special Purpose 
Reserve.
'Borders'- who borders the fence either in block number or property/park name

'Age'- approx age of fence in years (in 5 year groups) with 5 types
 >20, <20, <15, <10 & <5.
'Date'- similar to 'age' approx age of fence in year of construction 
(in 5 year groups) with 5 types pre 1980, 1980,1985,1990,1995.

Aliases- a variety of fence names/alias were created as a variety of students people collected fence data since 1995 (Any of these should be checked and transfered into the GIS Officer and then deleted.  NOW the current names WILLNOT change when a new fence is installed or old fence replaced.
